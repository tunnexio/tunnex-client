// SLICE 4 — Access. Last of the four ranked screens, and the only one whose case is CONSEQUENCE-based rather
// than finding-based. So the consequence is stated here, because it is the decision under test:
//
//   A RULE SHOWN AS ACTIVE BUT NOT COMPILED IS A SILENT AUTHORIZATION GAP —
//   the UI asserting access the gateway does not enforce.
//
// That is not the rule list's RENDERING. It is the relationship between what this screen claims about
// enforcement and what is actually being enforced, and it fails in two directions:
//
//   (a) rules listed while the org's mode is OFF        -> the UI implies enforcement that does not exist
//   (b) a FAILED load rendered as a count or an empty    -> the UI asserts a posture it never read
//
// Both are encoded in `rulesSummary`, which is why the assertions below drive it through the real page rather
// than restating its branches.
//
// QUERY RULES 1-4 BIND (docs/UI-REDESIGN-registration.md consequence 2): role + accessible name; mocked at the
// NETWORK boundary; decisions not rendering; and NO ASSERTION MAY ASSUME A VIEWPORT — nothing below depends on
// layout, column order, or an element visible only at one width.
