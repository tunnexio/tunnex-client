// Reading source in a test: the shared strippers.
//
// ⛔ A CENSUS OVER SOURCE STRIPS COMMENTS FIRST — AS THE STARTING SHAPE, NOT AS A FIX EACH TIME IT
// BITES. Ruled S14.20 after the THIRD instance in one epic of prose satisfying a search for code:
//
//   1. `placeholderglyph` banned an em-dash as a rendered value and caught its own explanatory
//      comment about em-dashes.
//   2. A `@ts-expect-error` written INSIDE a comment to describe one became a live directive.
//   3. The `client.html` entry check passed with the flip REVERTED, because the comment explaining
//      the flip contains "client.html".
//
// Every one was found by hand, after the fact, in a check that had already been reported green.
//
// > **A COMMENT IS THE MOST LIKELY PLACE IN A FILE FOR THE EXACT STRING A CENSUS HUNTS FOR** — the
// > code does the thing once, and the prose ABOUT the thing quotes it, explains it, and names the
// > alternative it rejected. A search over raw source is therefore biased toward finding the
// > explanation rather than the implementation, and the better-documented the file, the more
// > reliably the census lies.
//
// The direction of the lie is what makes it dangerous: it is FALSE GREEN. The census reports the
// thing present when only its description is present, so the failure is silent forever.
//
// ⚠ THE STRIPPER MUST MATCH THE LANGUAGE. There is no universal comment syntax, and using the
// JavaScript one on a YAML file strips nothing while looking like it worked — which is a green
// check that never ran. Hence one function per syntax, chosen at the call site.

/**
 * TS / TSX / JS.
 *
 * ⚠ `//` is stripped only at the START of a line. A mid-line strip would eat `"https://…"` out of
 * every URL string in the tree and turn real code invisible — trading a false green for a false
 * red. Trailing comments after code survive; they are rare and they sit next to the code that
 * would satisfy the search anyway.
 *
 * ⛔ LINE COMMENTS GO FIRST, AND THE ORDER IS NOT COSMETIC — THE OTHER ORDER SILENTLY ATE REAL CODE
 * ON THIS FILE'S SECOND DAY.
 *
 * `entry.ts` documents itself with a line comment containing the glob `app://tunnex/*.html`. Strip
 * blocks first and that `/*` — inside a `//` comment, where it means nothing — opens a PHANTOM
 * BLOCK that runs to the next `*&#47;`, swallowing the `export const CLIENT_ENTRY = …` line beneath
 * it. The census scanning for that constant found ZERO occurrences in a file that plainly contains
 * one.
 *
 * > **A REGEX STRIPPER HAS NO IDEA WHICH COMMENT IT IS INSIDE.** `/*` in a line comment is text;
 * > `//` in a block comment is text; neither regex knows. Removing line comments first eliminates
 * > the commoner of the two confusions — prose that quotes block syntax — at the cost of the
 * > rarer: a line comment inside a block that itself contains `*&#47;`. Both are pathological; only
 * > one showed up within a day.
 *
 * It cost a false RED here, which is the survivable direction. On an absence assertion the same
 * swallow reads as FALSE GREEN, and nothing would have surfaced it.
