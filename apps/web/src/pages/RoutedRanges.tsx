// ── S14.7 — ROUTED RANGES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The answer to "what LAN traffic goes down the tunnel", read from the SAME endpoint a device reads. That is
// the screen's whole value: not a reconstruction of what should be pushed, but the served projection itself.
//
// ⛔ TWO PANELS FROM THE HANDOFF ARE CUT, both recorded in docs/CUT-REGISTER.md before this file existed.
//
//   ADDRESS-SPACE HEATMAP — two independent reasons. A /24 lights a whole /16 cell, so the picture is
//   coarser than every range it draws; and the grid's domain is 10.0.0.0/8 while real customers use
//   172.16/12 and 192.168/16, which get NO CELLS AT ALL. A map that cannot draw two of the three private
//   blocks is not a map.
//
//   PENDING QUEUE — lives on Sites, because that is where the MUTATION ENDPOINT is: /site-subnets/pending
//   and /approve are `site:manage`, while /routed-ranges is `org:view` with no approve verb. (Its first
//   recorded reason was "the grid was cut, so this is read-only", which was DEPENDENT on the other cut and
//   would evaporate if the grid ever came back. THE GRID HAS SINCE COME BACK, and the reason held — which is
//   the whole argument for recording an INDEPENDENT reason at the time of the cut.)
//
// ⛔ THE HEATMAP WAS CUT AND IS NOW FOUNDER-RULED BACK IN — built with BOTH cut reasons closed rather than
// reproduced. See `mapAddressSpace`. The pending CELLS are legitimate here even though the pending QUEUE is
// not: the per-site fan-out this screen already issues for attribution returns pending subnets too, so they
// are real served data, and showing a withheld range as a dashed cell is the opposite of offering an
// approve control we have no permission for.
//
// SCALE: one row per range, constant height. N=many here is a /8 fully allocated — 256 /16s, or thousands of
// /24s — so there is nothing per-row that grows, and the teaching text renders once.

// ⛔ THE `STATUS` COLUMN IS CUT AS A CONSTANT COLUMN, and that is a statement about the endpoint.
// `/routed-ranges` is APPROVED-ONLY. A status column here would have exactly one value in every row of every
// org forever, which is not information — it is a column that teaches the reader the wrong thing, namely
// that some other value is possible on this screen.

// Legend rows, in the same order the eye meets them on the grid.
