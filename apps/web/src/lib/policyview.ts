 * is enormous:
 *
 * > **A GROUP OR SITE DESTINATION IS PORT-UNSCOPED BY CONSTRUCTION.** `compiler.go:442` and `:458` emit
 * > `Protocol: ProtoAny` — device-to-device and LAN destinations are L3, so there is no port to narrow. Only
 * > a resource or a Kubernetes Service carries protocol and ports.
 *
 * So "agent → group" grants ONE MACHINE UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO EVERY DEVICE OWNED BY EVERY MEMBER of that
 * group. That may be exactly what someone wants; it must not be something they discover afterwards.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A DESCRIPTION, NEVER A REFUSAL. Every pair below compiles and every one has a legitimate use.
