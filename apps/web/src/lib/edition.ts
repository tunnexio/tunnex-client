// THE EDITION SEAM — enumerated from the spec, not from memory.
//
// ⛔ THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, TWICE OVER. `403 edition_required` is a SUCCESSFUL REFUSAL: the server answered,
// correctly, that the capability does not exist for this edition. Read through `loadOne` alone it becomes
// `failed`, and the open edition renders a red "could not load" for a feature it was never sold.
//
// It was fixed once, at ONE call site (the Pending-approvals card), and the SAME defect was still live two
// cards over on Access Rules — because a fix at a call site does not reach the call sites beside it. That is
// the missing-primitive law's shape: only an ENUMERATION finds the rest.
//
// SO THE SET IS DATA, DERIVED FROM `openapi.yaml`, AND A TEST HOLDS IT TO THE SPEC. A new enterprise card
// cannot be added without registering its endpoint here, because the census will not find it guarded.
