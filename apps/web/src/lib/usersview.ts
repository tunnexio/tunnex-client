// ⛔ THE CLASSIFICATION THAT PRODUCED THIS FILE WAS WRONG FOUR TIMES BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, and the corrections
// are what these functions encode. My first pass grepped `Member`, found no auth source / device count / MFA
// state, and called them absent from the PRODUCT. Measured against the schema and the handlers instead:
//
//   N devices     SERVED         — `listDevices` returns the whole org for PermMemberManage; Device.user_id
//                                  is required. A client-side group-by, not the PEERS class (PEERS had NO field)
//   MFA           CATEGORY TWO   — `user_totp.confirmed` is persisted and NOT NULL; only the Member
//                                  projection is missing. Three fields, not a roadmap
//   AUTH          SPLIT          — `users.password_hash` makes "has a local password" derivable; per-member
//                                  SSO identity is genuinely absent (sso_configs is ORG-level, AuthMethod is
//                                  SESSION-scope)
//   idp-sync      VIA GROUPS     — the markers are per-GROUP, so it inherits PermPolicyView + edition
//
// docs/laws.md → BEFORE RECORDING AN ABSENCE, NAME THE TABLE. A DTO IS A PROJECTION; A SCHEMA IS THE PRODUCT.

// ── THE DEVICE COUNT, AND THE FALSE ZERO IT MUST NEVER RENDER ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⛔ `listDevices` IS AUDIENCE-SCOPED AT THE HANDLER:
//
//     if rbac.Can(role, rbac.PermMemberManage) { ListForOrg(...) } else { ListForUser(...) }
//
// So a MEMBER viewing the roster derives a group-by from a list containing ONLY THEIR OWN devices — and every
// other member would render `0 devices`.
//
//   A FALSE ZERO IS WORSE THAN AN ABSENCE. It is a positive claim about another person's fleet, drawn from a
//   response that was never about them. ABSENCE OF PERMISSION IS NOT ABSENCE OF DATA (ruled on Routed Ranges);
//   this is the same defect with a number instead of a cell.
//
// So the count is a THREE-ARMED value and `hidden` is a first-class arm, never a zero and never a dash-shaped
// "we don't know" that a reader would take for "none".

// ── THE AUTH LABEL IS NOT HERE, AND ITS ABSENCE IS DELIBERATE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⛔ I WROTE `authFact(hasPasswordHash)` AND THEN MEASURED THE PAYLOAD THAT WOULD FEED IT:
//
//     GET /organizations/{org}/members  keys served:
//       email · email_verified · joined_at · name · role · status · user_id
//     openapi.yaml Member: `additionalProperties: false`, exactly those seven
//
// **NO SERVED FIELD CARRIES `password_hash`.** So the function was a CONSUMER WITH NO PRODUCER — the
// who-reads-this probe run backwards, and by the DORMANT-MACHINERY LAW (S8.4, where a resolver release-rider
// dormant-until-S8.5 was ripped out rather than parked) it comes OUT rather than waiting for a story.
//
// The §2.3 RULING IT ENCODED IS NOT LOST — it lives in `docs/S14.11-decisions.md` §2.3, which is a decision
// record's job: the label stops at `local password` / `no local password` and NEVER infers SSO, because
// 237 of 241 users have `password_hash IS NULL` and the demo org has NO `sso_configs` row, so "no password ⇒
// SSO" is disproved by the first org anyone opens.
//
// D1b (registered): the AUTH column needs ONE projected boolean. It is the twin of D1's MFA column (three
// fields) and both are HELD for disposition — no spec change made unilaterally.

// ── THE FOUR GATES, DECIDED ONCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four different reasons content on this screen may not render, and deciding them per-cell produced a table of
// blanks in the first draft. Decided ONCE here so the screen has a shape rather than six holes:
//
//   MFA column        a PROJECTION that does not exist (user_totp is persisted; Member does not carry it)
//   N devices         member:manage — and the false zero above
//   idp-sync/locked   PermPolicyView + edition_required
//   teamMap edges     PermPolicyView + edition_required
//
// ⛔ GATED COLUMNS ARE ABSENT FROM THE COLUMN SET, NEVER DIMMED. The edition seam is a RENDER decision, never
// a style (epic rule): a column hidden by opacity is still in the DOM, still announced to a screen reader,
// still reachable by keyboard — "gone only to a sighted mouse user".
//
// ⛔ AND NOT THE S14.5 HALT IN REVERSE. That halt was an upsell shown for a capability the API treated as CORE.
// The inverse error is hiding something the open edition IS entitled to — so ONLY group-derived content is
// edition-gated here. Role, status, joined, email_verified and devices-for-admins are core and always render.

  //   ListGroups: `authorize(ctx, req.OrgId, rbac.PermPolicyView)` runs, THEN `if s.policy == nil`
  //   enterprise + member  -> 403 forbidden           (measured live: "you do not have permission")

  //                                                    its own comment reads "authorize() runs FIRST")

  // "Groups are a Tunnex Enterprise feature" — AN UPSELL SHOWN TO SOMEONE WHO WOULD NOT SEE GROUPS EVEN AFTER

//   role hierarchy         SERVED     — `Member.role`, a group-by over rows already loaded
//   MFA coverage           D1  HELD   — `user_totp.confirmed` is persisted but not projected
//   authentication sources D1b HELD   — `users.password_hash` is not projected either
//
// So the panel ships the third of it that is real. Rendering a subtitle that names all three and then showing
// one would be the panel promising what it cannot deliver — and `MFA enrolled 5/7` in particular is a NUMBER,
