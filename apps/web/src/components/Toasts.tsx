// S14.3 SLICE B — TOASTS, AND AN UNDO THAT IS A REAL COMPENSATING ACT.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES, all of which follow from the measured criterion in lib/undo.ts:
//
//  1. UNDO IS A REAL API CALL, AUDITED AS ITS OWN ACT. Never a client-side "put the row back". The audit log
//     must never imply the first act did not happen — it did, and someone may already have acted on it.
//
//  2. UNDO CAN FAIL, AND ITS FAILURE IS LOUD. It is a network call like any other. A silent failure would
//     leave the user believing they reversed something they did not — STRICTLY WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL
//     MISTAKE, because they have stopped worrying about it. So the failed toast does not auto-dismiss, says
//     what did not happen, and offers a retry.
//
//  3. A TOAST IS NOT A RECORD. It disappears. THE AUDIT LOG IS THE RECORD, and nothing may exist only as a
//     toast.
