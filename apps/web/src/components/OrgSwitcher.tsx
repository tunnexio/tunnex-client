 * OrgSwitcher selects which organization the UI acts on.

 * ⛔ IT RENDERS NOTHING WHEN THE CALLER HAS ONE ORGANIZATION, and that is not a cosmetic choice. Almost
 * every user has exactly one; a permanent control offering a choice that does not exist trains people to
 * ignore the place where a real choice will later appear.
 *
 * ⚠ SO ITS ABSENCE IS INFORMATION: seeing it means you belong to more than one tenant. That is a fact worth
 * knowing before you delete something.
 *
 * ⭐ AND IT GRANTS NOTHING. Selecting here changes which orgId the pages send; the server resolves the
 * caller's role from its own per-request membership query and answers 404 for anything else. This control
 * can only pick among organizations the server would already authorize.
