 * ⛔ THE GLASS RECIPE, IN ONE PLACE. Every surface in the product composes from this constant.

 * It was previously spelled out on `Stat` and NOT on `Panel`, so the stat row rendered as glass and every
 * panel below it rendered as flat plastic — in the same screenshot. A material defined per-component is a
 * material that WILL be half-applied, and the half that is missing reads as a rendering bug rather than a
 * missing class.
 *
 * `bg-surface` is TRANSLUCENT (`rgba(31,31,31,.72)`), and the blur needs the page's radial field behind it to
 * refract (index.css). Opaque fill or flat backdrop and the effect disappears entirely.
 *
 * NO INSET WHITE HIGHLIGHT LINE — the designer removed it explicitly. Do not reintroduce
 * `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,…)`.

  //
  // It was `bg-accent-500 text-white`. In the mono palette `--tnx-accent` is **#C9C9C4** — a LIGHT GREY — so
  // every primary button in the app rendered WHITE TEXT ON LIGHT GREY. It was legible under the old violet
  // accent (#7C5CFC) and stopped being legible the moment the palette was re-pointed at the handoff's mono
  // set, because the class names did not change and nothing asserts contrast.
  //
  // A SEMANTIC NAME SURVIVES A PALETTE SWAP; THE CONTRAST IT ASSUMED DOES NOT. `accent` kept meaning
  // "the accent", and the thing it pointed at went from dark-enough-for-white-text to far too light.
  //
  // THE FIX IS THE DESIGN'S OWN RECIPE (dc.html L449, the `+ Add site` button):
  //   background rgba(255,255,255,.16) · border rgba(255,255,255,.4) · blur(10px)
  //   shadow 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,.4) · color #F5F5F5
  // A 16%-white wash over a near-black page lands around #2F2F2F, so #F5F5F5 sits at roughly 12:1 — and it
  // stays legible on the glass panels too, which is why the design uses a translucent fill rather than a
  // solid one.
  //
  // ⚠ `backdrop-blur` makes an element a containing block for `position: fixed` descendants — the trap that
  // clipped five modals inside `Card`. Safe here: a button has no fixed descendants. Do not lift this recipe
  // onto a container without re-reading that law.

// The cost was not cosmetic and it was not confined to the UI. Query rule 1 says query by ROLE — and
// `role="table"` / `row` / `cell` DID NOT EXIST ANYWHERE TO QUERY, so every wiring test in the component tier
// worked around the gap by MATCHING TEXT. Text matching is the most brittle query there is and the first thing
// a redesign breaks. A missing semantic primitive degrades the UI once and the TESTS OF THAT UI a second time,
// and the second cost is invisible from either side: the tests look like they work, the components look like
// they render (docs/laws.md).
//
// So these primitives ship WITH their consumers converted and the tier's assertions re-pointed at roles. A
// primitive that ships while its consumers keep the workaround has only half landed.
